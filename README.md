# Open-Source Near-Field Probes

## Overview
This repository provides **KiCAD PCB designs** and documentation for **Near-Field Probes** used in **EMC troubleshooting**

## Features
- **KiCAD PCB designs** for Magnetic (H-field) and Electric (E-field) probes
- **Gerber files** for easy fabrication

## Usage
1. **Download the KiCAD files** and generate Gerbers or use the ones available.
2. **Fabricate the PCB** and assemble the probes.
3. **Calibrate** the probe using a VNA
4. **Perform near-field scanning** for EMC diagnostics

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit **pull requests** with improvements or new probe designs.
